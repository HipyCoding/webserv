ana		server now waits for the complete request body. i fixed the function		ana
		handleClientData, now it waits for complete Content-Length and wont
		process until body is complete. It also handles Content-Length: 0
		correctly.

chris	server looks for "\r\n\r\n" or "\n\n" and then just handles the buffer 		chris
			immidiately, instead of waiting for Content-Length amount of bytes
			within the body. we should wait for the complete request body, so 
			we can handle file uploads and CGI later. nginx seems to respond
			immediately too, but it reads request bodies, when actually needed.

chris	more functional config parsing, i think i focus on this for now		 		chris
